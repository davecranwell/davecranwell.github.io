If you haven't already seen it, have a look at the new Myspace promo video.

From what we can see, the new myspace will bring many familiar areas of function. The posting of images, music or videos, the creation and sharing of collections of the above too, discovering similar people by interest or location etc. As many commentators have pointed out, it appears to be an amalgam of existing microblogging systems, notably Pinterest and Tumblr, focussing on the visual appeal of a wall of eye-catching updates that may take your fancy. 

For brand owners too there looks to be some heavy borrowing from sites like flavours.me and bandcamp.com, where a constant stream of updates isn't as important as simply having a presence and providing terse information
