What's odd is that in the world of development teams where _everything_ becomes a documented process, or code of conduct, or concensus of behaviour, this is still poorly handled.

In an ideal world, collaborative environments would have rules of engagement when entering into a conversation. However enforcing them across teams over which you have no control is next to impossible and lets be honest, you mostly come across looking like a dick.

But what would those rule look like if they did exist? Here's my shot at them:

## 1. Plan your interruption

If you need to interrupt someone, literally plan your interruptive sentence word by word. What is required for your colleague to respond appropriately?

**Do** 
1. Be polite but terse.
2. Say "May I interrupt you?". Courtesy costs nothing.
3. Include one or more of:
    1. The urgency of the problem 
    2. Whether you're blocked 
    3. An estimate of how much of their time you'll need.
  
e.g "Hi Dave, may I interrupt you? I've need a 5 minute code review.". "Hi Dave, may I interrupt you? I'm blocked and I need to ship this in an hour".

**Don't** 
 
1. Include forced pleasantries. Your colleague may already be annoyed, don't waste their time with etiquette. 
2. Provide any technical details whatsoever. If the person you interrupt has the knowledge, their mind will immediately race to solve the problem presented, try as they might to block it out. Their productivity will plummet.

## 2. You are always interruptible

But if your colleague has followed the steps above, you should be able to triage the interruption with minimal impact on your productivity. Importantly: **Having heard them out, you reserve the right to immediately postpone the interruption when necessary**. 

Many people suggest if you don't want to be disturbed you should wear headphones. This works some of the time, but you're neglecting your obligations to function as a team member. Your colleague needs their question answered. Are they to waste their own time repeatedly checking whether you still have your headphones on every few minutes? 

Even if you're focusing on a problem, you should be able to spare the cognitive capacity to politely reply "No problem, I'll come and find you in 30 minutes once I've finished this" or "Please come over again in 30 minutes".

## 3. Take responsibility for helping

If your colleague is blocked and their summary suggests it's mission-critical, consider taking one for the team and dropping what you're doing. Greater good and all that.

If you postponed an interruption and your colleague comes over again after the elapsed time, remember that you have managed to continue working efficiently. You got your shot, now give your colleague theirs.

## 4. Take responsibility for working without help

If you've got a problem that only Jane The DB Guru can help you with, tell her, then find something else to do. You can't continue that work now, but Jane _will_ help you if he's signed up to these rules. 

Your productivity has already hit rock bottom (why else did you need to interrupt Jane?) so the best you can do is to move onto something more productive in the meantime. A change of scene may give you fresh perspective to solve it on your own.
