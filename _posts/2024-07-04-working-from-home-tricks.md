When COVID19 hit and the world was turned upside down a small part of me punched the air. We cleared out the office we'd never return to and my team split to the four winds, taking monitors and in some cases whole desks.

I wanted to be remote. I'd been hoping to do it for a while and the
dea of being supported to Work From Home was at that point a distinct plus-point in my employer's favour. No more commute! No more of the same sandwich from that same shop. I would miss the food stalls that visited the business park, but "think of the savings you'll make on not eating those Â£10 burgers!" I told myself.

commute = music = good
