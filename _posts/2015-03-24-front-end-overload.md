I've been feeling the pressure recently. Not pressure to get the project finished or to perform at work, rather the pressure to be up to date.

I'm not alone, Googling [yields](http://alistapart.com/blog/post/overwhelmed-by-code) [several](http://www.sitepoint.com/not-get-overwhelmed-web-developer/) [prominent](http://modernweb.com/2014/03/31/paralyzed-by-choice-in-front-end-development/) [posts](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7169299) on the topic, including that last one which takes an unexpected turn into a brutally revealing and clearly very knowledgeable porn analogy.

Front End definitely has a bit of a problem with reinventing the wheel in the Framework department, but you can't really blame people for wanting to try. Give someone a programming language and they'll optimise it for their most common scenarios - that's the nature of abstraction and DRY. The inevitable result is umpteen frameworks that all do the same thing in a different way.

The trouble isn't that wheel-reinvention occurs, it's that so many of us feel compelled to keep up with it. I'm intrigued why. There's certainly a degree of obsolsescence anxiety. A degree of Imposter Syndrome too no doubt. _"What if I'm asked to do it?"_, _"What if someone finds out I can't?"_.

My suspicion is that what many of the authors of these anxiety posts don't explain, is that they follow their peers too avidly. In answering _"How do you keep up?"_ I've seen suggestions of the best people/accounts/feeds to follow as a way of filtering the noise. Very rarely have I see this question answered with my answer: _"Why do you have to keep up?"_.

Imposter Syndrome is what I suffer from most. _"I can't justify being here, I'm replaceable, just look at all these over-achievers around me! I know, I'll learn EVERYTHING to make myself indispensible!"_

Twitter is to mostly to blame for this. I keep an eye on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news), [A List Apart](A List Apart), [Codrops](http://tympanus.net/codrops/) et al, but the real problem is Twitter. I can't control what sites choose to write about, but I've **chosen** to follow those Twitter accounts and all they do is make my own achievements feel reduced.

Here's an idea: if you're browsing Twitter and you notice anxiety creeping up, chest tightening, the dread of discovering Yet Another Framework you don't know: unfollow it. Ain't nobody got time for that shit. You've only got one life, you don't need to be feeling constantly up tight and underachieving.
