I've been feeling the pressure recently. Not pressure to get the project finished, or to perform at work, rather the pressure to be up to date.

I'm not alone, Googling [yields](http://alistapart.com/blog/post/overwhelmed-by-code) [several](http://www.sitepoint.com/not-get-overwhelmed-web-developer/) [prominent](http://modernweb.com/2014/03/31/paralyzed-by-choice-in-front-end-development/) [posts](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7169299) on the topic, including that last one which takes an unexpected turn into a brutally revealing and clearly very knowledgeable porn analogy.

Front End definitely has a bit of a problem with reinventing the wheel in the Framework department, but you can't really blame people for wanting to try. Give someone a programming language and they'll try and optimise it for their most common scenarios - that's the nature of abstraction and DRY. The inevitable result is umpteen frameworks that all do the same thing in a different way.

The trouble isn't that wheel-reinvention occurs, it's that so many of us feel the need to keep up with it. I'm intrigued why. There's certainly a degree of obsolsescence anxiety. A degree of Imposter Syndrome too no doubt.
