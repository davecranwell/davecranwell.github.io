So long story short, it turns out i'm one quarter Russian-Jew!  A rambling, but rarely personal conversation with my parents got onto the topic of what their parents and grand parents did in the war. My father pulled out some kind of journal that my father's father kept when he was ordered to fix up battleship electrics on the Tees, and although my mother had broken contact with her father over that period she was still able to tell me that her own grandfather came to England from Odessa, Russia, some time around the first World War. Assuming both her grandparents were Russian and therefore her father full-Russian, that makes me quarter-Russian! Brilliant!

Anyway the whole conversation got me wondering what my own children would be able to tell their children about what I did during the Browser wars of the Noughties, or where I was when I heard the <em>N</em>th Dot-com bubble had burst. I'm sure the conversation will go something like,

"So what did Grandad do?"
"He was a web developer"
"Oh, so not a spy, or a commando, or a fireman or something cool?
"No, but he was active during the h.264/WebM civil war"
"........K. Moving on..."

So basically i've set up this site as a place to ramble, record, discuss, rant etc. I've had several sites in the past on which i've done roughly the same, but lost interest as I never really had any reason to write on it, but now I do. 

What can you expect on here? Probably some geeky web-related stuff, hopefully something insightful about my imminent wedding, maybe, just maybe <del>I'll tear your soul apart</del> something about future kids!
